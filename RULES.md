<b>Rules for PR</b>
- The file must have a valuable snippet of code which is useful.
- Place the files in the respective programming language folders.
- Give a short descriptive commit title. Eg. Updated File :x:, Added palindrome in Python :heavy_check_mark:
- Pull requests must be having a similar descriptive title.

That's it! Wait for the PR to be reviewed and merged into the repository.
