<b>Rules to check before opening a pull request</b>

---

- The file must have a valuable snippet of code which is useful.
- Go through the Pull Requests Section to avoid duplication.
- Place the files in the respective programming language folders. If folder doesn't exist, create one.
- Give a short descriptive commit title. Eg. `Updated File` :x:, `Added palindrome in Python` :heavy_check_mark:
- Pull requests must be having a similar descriptive title.

That's it! Wait for the PR to be reviewed and merged into the repository.
